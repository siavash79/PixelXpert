This is a mixed Xposed+Magisk module, which is made to allow customizations that are not originally designed in AOSP (Android Open Source Project).

**Features:**
Currently, AOSP Mods offers customizations on different aspects of system framework and SystemUI, including:
- Status bar
- Lock screen
- Notifications
- Quick Settings panel
- Gestural Navigations
- Screen properties

**Compatibility:**
This module is designed based on AOSP source code. What does it mean? it means that it's expected to work on Roms (Firmwares) which are built based on fairly unmodified Android source code. This means, mainly, Pixel Phones (3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7), and any other Roms that haven't heavily modified the original Android codes. Our feedbacks show that AOSPMods is compatible with Pixel stock Roms and Pixel Experience (normal edition). The mod can also be installed on ArrowOS, Pixel Experience (Plus Edition), ProtonAOSP and LineageOS with *some* broken features.

- Android 12:         Compatible
- Android 12.1 (12L): Compatible
- Android 13:         Compatible
   

**Prerequisites:**
- Compatible Roms (see above)
- Device Rooted by Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version)


**How to install:**
- Install the magisk module
- Reboot (bootloops are not expected, but user should always be prepared for the worst)
- You can use AOSPMods app to configure the module

The module is released in 2 flavors, which download and update procedures are different:
- Stable release:  
Manual Install/Update: through repository's Github release page (link below)  
Automated updates: through magisk manager, or through in-app updater  
- Canary release:  
Manual Install/Update: only through repository's Actions page  
Automated install/updates: only through in-app updater - updates will NOT appear in release section, and will NOT count against the module's download count  

*No matter which flavor you're on, you can always switch to the other one with in-app updater
